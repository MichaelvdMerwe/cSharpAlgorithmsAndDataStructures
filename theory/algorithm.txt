Algorithm is a correctly defineed computational procedure which has an input and an output

Algorithm is a sequence of steps transforming an input to an output

We need Algorithms for solving correctly defined computational problems

Algorithm is always formalized and it non-ambiguously defines the computational procedure for reaching the desired results


Algorithm is correct if for any valid and correct input it produces a correct output

Algorithms includes:
    1. Description of a correct input
    2. Full description of computational steps
    3. Description of a correct output

Algorithms often provide an implementation in pseudo-code

ADT is an abstract description of how a specific set of data can be organized and which operations can be performed on that set of data
A data structure is a concrete implementation of an ADT

ADT can describe a stack as a data type which allows to store data and perform push, pop and peek operations

Stack has an abstract definition and a concrete implementation

Data structures are based on primitive data types(string, int, etc)
primitive data tpes are basic building blocks
